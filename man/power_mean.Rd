  n = NULL,
  power = 0.8,

  N = Inf,

\arguments{
\item{delta}{Effect size (difference in means). Leave \code{NULL} to solve
for MDE.}

\item{var}{Within-group variance (required).}

\item{n}{Per-group sample size. Leave \code{NULL} to solve for sample size.}

\item{power}{Target power, in (0, 1). Leave \code{NULL} to solve for power.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level, default 0.05.}

\item{N}{Per-group population size. \code{Inf} (default) means no finite
population correction.}

\item{deff}{Design effect multiplier (>= 1).}

\item{sides}{\code{1} for one-sided or \code{2} (default) for two-sided test.}

\item{overlap}{Panel overlap fraction in [0, 1], for repeated surveys.}

\item{rho}{Correlation between occasions in [0, 1].}
}
\value{
A \code{svyplan_power} object.
}
\description{
Compute sample size, power, or minimum detectable effect (MDE) for a
two-sample test of means. Leave exactly one of \code{n}, \code{power}, or \code{delta}
as \code{NULL} to solve for that quantity.
}
\details{
The effective variance for the difference in means is:

\deqn{V = 2 \cdot \text{var} \cdot (1 - \text{overlap} \cdot \rho)}

The factor of 2 accounts for the two independent groups, reduced by
the panel overlap term (Kish, 1965, Ch. 11).
\itemize{
\item \strong{Solve n}: \eqn{n_0 = (z_{\alpha/s} + z_\beta)^2 \cdot V \cdot
  \text{deff} / \delta^2}, then finite population correction.
\item \strong{Solve power}: Compute SE, then
\eqn{\text{power} = \Phi(\delta / \text{SE} - z_{\alpha/s})}.
\item \strong{Solve MDE}: Analytical formula,
\eqn{\delta = (z_{\alpha/s} + z_\beta) \sqrt{V \cdot \text{deff}
  \cdot (1-f) / n}}.
}

\examples{
# Sample size to detect a difference of 5 with variance 100
power_mean(delta = 5, var = 100)

# Power given n = 200
power_mean(delta = 5, var = 100, n = 200, power = NULL)

# MDE with n = 500
power_mean(var = 100, n = 500)

# With design effect
power_mean(delta = 5, var = 100, deff = 1.5)
