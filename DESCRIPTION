Description: Tools for survey sample size determination, precision
    analysis, optimal allocation, stratification, and power analysis.
    Computes sample sizes for proportions and means, evaluates sampling
    precision for a given design, optimizes multistage cluster allocations,
    estimates variance components from frame data, computes design effects,
    finds optimal strata boundaries, and performs statistical power
    analysis for two-sample tests. All functions support response rate
    adjustment and bidirectional round-trip between sample size and
    precision via S3 dispatch. Sensitivity analysis is available through
    predict methods. Based on methods from Cochran (1977,
    ISBN:978-0-471-16240-7), Kish (1965, ISBN:978-0-471-48900-9), and
    Valliant, Dever, and Kreuter (2018, ISBN:978-3-319-93630-4).
